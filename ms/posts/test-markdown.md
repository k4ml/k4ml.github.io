```python
if using_nikola:
    print 'yes'
```
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Using 5.3 ?</p>
<p class="last">
    This tutorial is based on Nikola from github master. Some details are not
    correct for the 5.3 release. Master works quite well most of the time, but you may
    want to wait until the 5.4 release in a few days (which will include an updated version of
    this document).

</div>

```php
<?php
if ($using_nikola) {
    print 'yes';
}
```

Two popular plain text markup formats are Markdown and reST. Markdown usage is pretty ubiquitous; itâ€™s used by many blogs, sites like reddit and github, etc. The Python project uses reST, and has the Sphinx doc processing tool generate their html docs, as do lots of other Python-based projects.
