    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Kamal Bin Mustafa, mostly people will just call me Kamal. I am a Malaysian living in the southern State of Johor, near Singapore. Online, I mostly know through my handle k4ml.</p>
    
    <p>I have been a web developer since early 2000 where my first professional experience was in building PHP web applications. We build numerous applications for government agencies such as JKR, KKR, JPN, JPM etc. My next job was with a software agency in Singapore where we build e-commerce websites for our clients using Drupal CMS. Since 2010, I have worked at Xoxzo Inc building web telephony API and managed to grow the company from 2 people into a team of 10 engineers working fully remotely spanning multiple cities from Tokyo to Seoul, Manila, KL, Jakarta, Ufa and Kolkatta. Xoxzo Inc was acquired by a public listed company in Tokyo, Accrete Inc. in 2021.</p>
