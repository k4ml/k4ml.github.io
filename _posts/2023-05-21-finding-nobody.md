It's hard to search for "nobody"'s blog posts these days. Take for example when I searched for "why all todos apps doesn't works?".
All the frontpage results are from some brands, except for a blog post from [Scott Hanselman][1] and Jeff Attwood's [Codding Horror][2] on the third page. But they are hardly "nobody" anymore.

The only way to get through some random blog posts these days is through the link aggregator sites such as reddit, hackernews, lobster etc.
