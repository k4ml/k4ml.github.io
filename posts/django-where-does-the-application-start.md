The key to understand any kind of application is to know where does it start. Until
then you'll keep banging your head, shooting in the dark and lastly, at the mercy
of Google when trying to debug or solve any issues you have.

Majority of web developers don't really know, or even care where actually their application
start. This particularly true for those developing in PHP which abstract most of the web parts
and it appear to developer they just writing a regular command line or desktop application.

For Django developer, you can probably ignore this throughout your dev carrier but knowing it
will help you a lot in.

Django application can start (at least) from 2 possible entry point. The first entry point is
through the development server and the second entry point is when you deploy it to production
web server, either `mod_wsgi`, `gunicorn`, `Paste`, `Rocket`, `Waitress`, `Circus` or dozen more
WSGI server you can find on PyPI. I can still remember the day when there's none pure Python
WSGI server exists (except CherryPy) and how I'd really envy Rails's community for having Mongrel.
That day has long gone.

Let's dive to the first entry point - when you run your django application through the
`manage.py runserver` command. Typical django application (as generated) by the `startproject` command
has a file called `manage.py` at the root of the project directory. This is the file that developer use
to interact with their application, doing things such as running development server, synching database
tables with the models definition, loading/exporting data and so much more.

If you peek into `manage.py`, it's pretty simple actually:-

```python
#!./bin/python
import os
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "acara.settings")

    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)
```

They key line here is at line 10 where a function called `execute_from_command_line()` being called.
From here we can traverse to module `django.core.management` to find out what that function is doing.
If you're sure where the actual module is located, just open the python console and import the module
to inspect it's location:-


```console
$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Aug  1 2012, 05:16:07) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import django.core.management
>>> django.core.management
<module 'django.core.management' from '/home../local/lib/...django/core/management/__init__.pyc'>
```
Now we know that module was in `$HOME/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py`.
This one thing I love in python. Everything is explicit. You can easily trace down where things comes from
without even having to understand the whole framework yet. In some other framework or languages where
implicit import is a norm, you'll have hard time tracing down where certain functions or variables comes from
until you know the mechanism of the framework.

Let's look what inside `django.core.management` module. The function `execute_from_command_line()` was defined
at the bottom of the source code. It just a wrapper to other function actually.

```python
def execute_from_command_line(argv=None):
    """
    A simple method that runs a ManagementUtility.
    """
    utility = ManagementUtility(argv)
    utility.execute()
```
